Additional report in part A3f:
In the additional report, users can view a summary of appointments and customer distribution across different divisions. The report is divided into three sections:

1. A detailed list of appointments that can be filtered by selecting a specific customer from the dropdown menu.
    Users can view appointment ID, title, description, location, contact ID, type, start and end date, customer ID, and user ID for each appointment.

2. A summary of appointments broken down by month and type, along with the total number of appointments for each combination.
    This provides users with an overview of the most common appointment types during specific months.
